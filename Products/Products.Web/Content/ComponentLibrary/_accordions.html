<h1>Accordions and toggles</h1>

<p>Question to UX - Should the contents be flush with the left margin, or indented as shown?</p>

<p>Differences from classic accordions</p>
<ul class="bullet-list">
    <li>Hitbox over entire head area, not just H2</li>
    <li>left padding of content smaller</li>
    <li>Extra aria roles and attributes with unique id on each content block</li>
    <li>Classes have been renamed and have moved</li>
</ul>
