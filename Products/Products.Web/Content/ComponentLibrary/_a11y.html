<h1>Accessibility (A11y)</h1>

<p>Make sure you test all pages at minimum using:</p>
<ul class="bullet-list">
    <li>Keyboard only navigation</li>
    <li>Screen reader (such as ChromeVox and/or iPhone speech)</li>
</ul>

<h2>General guidelines</h2>

<p>
    If you design for those who have the hardest time on our sites
    - keyboard only users, voice only users etc -
    you should end up with a product which is easier for <em>all</em> your users.
</p>

<ul class="bullet-list">
    <li>Make sure any button taken out of context has hidden screen-reader text. e.g. [buy] button should have "buy x product at y price" when listened to by a screen reader. Example: buttons on OJB slot booking calendar page</li>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>
